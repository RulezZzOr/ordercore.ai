It provides a production-ready foundation for:
- product catalog and SKU management
- pricing and inventory operations
- order creation and lifecycle handling
- webhook integrations and automation flows
- tenant-scoped API key authentication

## Why OrderCore

Teams use OrderCore to launch AI-ready commerce operations faster, without rebuilding core backend primitives from scratch.
